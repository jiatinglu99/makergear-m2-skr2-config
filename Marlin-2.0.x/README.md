# Marlin Config file for SKR 2 Mod on MakerGear M2 (rev G)

This folder contains Marlin config files based on values provided from [MakerGear's repo](https://github.com/MakerGear/m2firmware). I used this on my SKR only for a few days, then switched to Klipper. Provided for reference only, I cannot guarantee they'll work safely on your machine.
